Description:
TM2 Monitoring System version 3.04 contains an authentication bypass
vulnerability that allows unauthenticated users to access administrative
functionality. The application relies solely on client-side JavaScript to
enforce authentication, while sensitive server-side endpoints do not verify
session state or authentication tokens.

By directly requesting protected PHP resources, an attacker can gain full
administrative access and retrieve hardcoded credentials.

Proof of Concept:

1. Navigate to the login page:

   http://target-ip/login.php

   Authentication is expected at this point; however, access control is only
   implemented via client-side JavaScript.

2. Send a direct unauthenticated request to a protected endpoint using a web
   proxy (e.g., Burp Suite) or curl:

   GET /security.php HTTP/1.1
   Host: target-ip

3. The server responds with the full contents of security.php without validating
   authentication or session state.

4. Within the returned HTML response, the following credentials are exposed:

   <input name="pw_admin" value="P@ssword123" type="text">
   <input name="pw_guest" value="GuesP@ss" type="text">

Impact:
An unauthenticated attacker can bypass login controls, access administrative
functionality, and retrieve valid credentials, resulting in full compromise of
the application.

Remediation:
Implement proper server-side authentication checks for all sensitive endpoints.
Do not rely on client-side controls for access enforcement. Remove hardcoded
credentials from application responses.
