## Disclaimer

This vulnerability was discovered during a penetration test conducted for a client using the TM2 Monitoring System. The finding was identified during authorized internal testing within scope, and no exploitation beyond proof-of-concept was performed. This disclosure is made in the interest of responsible vulnerability reporting and improving overall software security.

---

## Summary

TM2 Monitoring v3.04 is vulnerable to a **remote authentication bypass** and **plaintext credential disclosure** due to:

- Reliance on **client-side JavaScript** for access control
- Absence of **server-side session validation**
- Exposure of **sensitive credentials** (`admin` and `user`) in unauthenticated HTML responses

---

## Technical Details

### Affected Endpoint:
  /security.php


### Issue:
An attacker can bypass login by directly requesting `/security.php` using a proxy like Burp Suite. The response reveals:

```html
<input name="pw_admin" value="REDACTED" type="text">
<input name="pw_guest" value="REDACTED" type="text">
